# PLT-2882 — investigation log (execution of the evidence step)

Continues `recommended-action.md` § "The one evidence step to run". Owner: Ilia Kuzmin.

## 2026-07-14 — new e2e observation narrows the failure layer

Ilia walked the repro on the affected project:

- Activity property panel shows **"linked elements — 418"**.
- Clicking the count lists **2 models** the elements are assigned to.
- **Both models were loaded**, then context menu → **Select linked elements** → **0 selected**.

This kills one of the two candidate failure modes from `context.md` § Mechanism (menu
greyed-out vs clickable-no-effect):

- The panel's count and its **model list are built from resolved `ElementEntity`s**
  (`linking-service.ts:757-761` → `ElementEntity.getModels()`), so the 418 UUIDs **do
  resolve in `projectService.elements`** — the layer-2 drop (registry orphans) is NOT
  where these die.
- Both membership models are loaded, so "model not loaded" is out too.
- Remaining suspects, in order:
  1. **Viewer maps miss** — `viewerService.elementId2DbId` / `elementId2ModelId` are keyed
     by `sourceFileElementId` (externalId) and built from the **loaded geometry's**
     externalId→dbId table, intersected with the model's cloud element list
     (`model-mapping-service.ts:226-242`, `hasExternalIdInCloud` guard at `:227-230`).
     If the element records carry externalIds from a **superseded model version** (the
     `..._REV1-V23` lineage), the lookups miss and selection is empty. This is the
     orphaned-generation hypothesis, one layer deeper than the registry.
  2. **Filter intersection** — if any model filter is active,
     `use-linked-element-actions.ts:47-50` intersects with `allowedDbIdsByModel`; a model
     with **no entry** in that map drops **everything** silently.

## Zero-code differential test (10 s, decides filter vs maps)

Same context menu → **Isolate linked elements** (`use-linked-element-actions.ts:65-91`)
uses the *identical* map lookups but **skips the filter intersection**:

- **Isolate works, select doesn't** → filter path. Clear active filter chips, retry.
  (Also an FE bug on its own: an absent `allowedDbIdsByModel` entry nukes selection with
  no feedback.)
- **Isolate also does nothing** (its empty branch calls `showAll()`) → viewer-map miss →
  externalId generation mismatch between element records and loaded geometry.

## Diagnostic branch (implements the evidence step end-to-end)

Branch **`PLT-linked-selection-diagnostics`** (based on master, commit `6ed38b7f0`,
console.log only, NOT for merge). Adds `window.__linkDiagnose(activityId?)` in
`LinkingService` — with an activity selected (or an explicit id) it prints one JSON blob
walking every layer; the first count that drops from ~418 is the culprit:

| Field | Layer it tests |
|---|---|
| `rawLinkCount` | activity_links bridge (the Gantt/panel count) |
| `resolvedEntityCount` / `unresolvedUuidSample` | UUID → `projectService.elements` registry |
| `withExternalIdCount` | entity → `sourceFileElementId` present |
| `modelMembership` | claimed mongo models, loaded state, cloud-list size |
| `loadedForgeModels` | what the viewer actually has + mongo mapping |
| `dbIdHitCount` / `dbIdMissSample` | externalId → `elementId2DbId` (likely cliff) |
| `cloudCheckByMongoModelId` | externalId in cloud element list / direct `getDbIdForElement` |
| `activeFilterCount` / `allowedDbIdsByModel` | filter intersection state |
| `simulatedSelectionByForgeModelId` | exact before/after-filter dbId counts selection would produce |

Run steps: checkout branch → editor page on FAR01 → load both models → select
`FAR01UGD1220` → `__linkDiagnose()` → paste JSON back.

Run the same call for **one working activity** in the same model — the broken-vs-working
diff (playbook move #3) is the confirmation `recommended-action.md` asks for.

## Routing once JSON is in

- `dbIdHitCount ≈ 0`, `cloudCheckByMongoModelId` low → **orphaned externalId generation**
  → data fix (re-link / clean stale `activity_links`) → BE/data; FE keeps the secondary
  robustness fix (surface "N of M linked elements aren't in the loaded model").
- `dbIdHitCount ≈ 418` but `afterFilter = 0` → **filter path bug/state** → FE fix
  (don't drop to `[]` on a missing `allowedDbIdsByModel` entry; give feedback).

## 2026-07-14 — ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED (diagnostic run, twice, incl. cold cache)

`__linkDiagnose()` on activity `7c4f2509-3bce-4005-971d-46e82610b1a4` ("Retired", 418 links).
Run twice: normally, then again after wiping OPFS (`duckdb-cache`). **Byte-identical output** —
so this is **not** a stale client cache.

**Where the 418 die — every layer passes until one:**

| Layer | Result |
|---|---|
| `activity_links` bridge | 418 |
| → `projectService.elements` registry | **418** resolved, 0 unresolved |
| → `sourceFileElementId` present | **418** |
| → model membership | both models, both `isLoaded: true` |
| → active filters | **0** (filters are innocent) |
| → viewer `elementId2DbId` (87,854 entries) | **`dbIdHitCount: 0`** ← the cliff |
| → `parquetVsGeometryByMongoModelId` | `inParquet: 418`, `inGeometry: 0`, **`inParquetNotInGeometry: 418`** — on **both** models |

**Verdict: the element-metadata parquet and the SVF geometry disagree, for the same model
version.** `model.elementId2dbId` is the INTERSECTION of the loaded geometry's externalIds and
the model's `client-element-metas` parquet (`model-mapping-service.ts:372-384`). All 418 are in
the parquet; **none** are in the geometry. The links are valid, the registry is valid, the
metadata is valid — the geometry simply has no such elements.

**The 4 source files behind the 418 (`<sourceFileGuid>-<handle>` externalIds):**

| Source file GUID | Linked | Present in loaded geometry |
|---|---|---|
| `bb85941b-…` | 141 | **18,908** elements — file fully loaded, yet **0 of the 141 handles exist** |
| `908dd088-…` | 180 | 25 — all but gone |
| `3bb78c12-…` | 96 | **0** — absent |
| `72715ba4-…` | 1 | **0** — absent |

`bb85941b` is decisive and kills the simple "a source file was deleted" story: that file is
**present and large** in the geometry, but the *specific element handles* the links point at are
gone. So the links reference a **superseded generation of model content** — source files since
removed (`3bb78c12`, `72715ba4`), shrunk (`908dd088`), or **re-exported with new handles**
(`bb85941b`) — consistent with the `REV1-V23` / `V35` re-versioning.

This **confirms the assignee-team hypothesis** (Ilia, 2026-07-13) with one correction: it is
**not** that a *project model* was deleted (both models are present and loaded). It is that
content *inside* the federated models was re-versioned, and both `activity_links` **and the
element-metadata parquet** still carry the dead generation.

### Two tracks, both now precisely scoped

**1. Data / pipeline (root cause — BE).** One question, answerable with a query:
> For model `PC-APLD-FAR01-UND-AKS_REV1-V23` (`210b8255-20b7-4549-b44c-c23f88ecd3e5`), why does
> its `client-element-metas` parquet contain 418 elements whose `sourceFileElementId`s are absent
> from the same model version's SVF / `svf2-object-id-map`? Were those source files removed or
> re-exported, and is the element-meta artefact regenerated on re-version?

Then: clean/re-link the stale `activity_links`, and enumerate the cohort (all activities whose
links resolve to 0 — likely most "(Retired)" ones).

**2. FE robustness (ours, real regardless).** The panel's "418" comes from parquet-resolved
`ElementEntity`s; selection needs geometry, which has 0 — and `setAggregateSelection([])` fails
**silently**. We show a count the user can never act on, then do nothing. Fix: surface
"N of M linked elements are not in the loaded model(s)" (toast or panel note), and reflect it in
the count/menu-enablement. Owner: Darminder / FE.

Confidence: **root cause 9/10** (mechanism read from source, confirmed by data, cache excluded,
reproduced twice). Remaining unknown is purely *why* the pipeline left the metadata behind — a
BE question, not an FE one.

Status: diagnostic complete. Branch `PLT-linked-selection-diagnostics` (rebased on master,
`console.log` only — **not for merge**). Awaiting BE answer + FE robustness ticket.

## 2026-07-14/15 — cohort sweep attempts, 418-list verified, peer pushback answered

### Cohort sweep: two tools failed, third works, BE still the right owner

Goal: list ALL orphaned links project-wide (playbook #6), not just this activity's 418.

1. **`__linkAudit()` (viewer-based) — failed.** FAR01 has **103 models**, not 2 (the "2" was
   only this activity's membership). Needs every model rendered; worse, it silently counted
   unresolvable elements as "unresolved" instead of failing loudly → reported 0 orphans with
   both target models unloaded. Retired.
2. **`scripts/orphaned-links-sweep.mjs` (artefact-based, runs on prod, read-only GETs) —
   blind on this project.** Run result: 101 models, only **22 have an `svf2-object-id-map`
   artefact**. Reason (code-verified): the artefact is produced for **Navisworks** models only
   (`navisworks-model-mapper.ts:277`); **Revit** models get their externalId→dbId mapping from
   Forge's property DB at load time (`revit-model-mapper.ts:22`) — no artefact exists. Both
   PLT-2882 models are Revit. The 705k "orphans" from that run are useless (false positives);
   CSV discarded.
3. **Working combo (no branch deploy, prod-safe):**
   - `scripts/console-geometry-harvest.js` — paste into prod editor console; loads each model's
     Forge **property DB only** (`skipMeshLoad` + `loadAsHidden`, no meshes/render), harvests
     `getExternalIdMapping` keys, unloads, downloads the union as a txt.
   - `scripts/orphaned-links-sweep.mjs --geometry <file>` — translates harvested externalIds →
     modelElementIds via each model's `client-element-metas` parquet, anti-joins activity_links.
   All read-only (explicit `method: 'GET'` everywhere; only writes are local files).
   Still: the cleaner long-term answer is a **BE-side query** against the translation data, and
   a pipeline ask to **emit object-id-map for Revit too** (would also help dashboard selective
   loading).

### The 418 deletion list — verified against live API

Console pull of all activity-links for activity `7c4f2509-3bce-4005-971d-46e82610b1a4`:
**10,316 rows total → 9,898 `isDeleted` (link/unlink history) → 418 live**, distinct elements
418 — exactly matches the editor. Gotcha for future scripts: the GET endpoint returns history;
**always filter `!isDeleted`**, and paginate (1.84M links project-wide; `size` max 50k).

Deletion path (not executed yet): `POST /api/v2/projects/{pid}/elements/activity-links/delete`
with `[{activityId, modelElementId}]` (≤500/batch as the FE does; needs ELEMENT_EDIT+DELETE).
Soft-delete; editor picks it up on sync. CSV of the 418 exported as the audit record.

### Peer pushback (Jira comment) and the answer

A developer checked a sample element and found it **present in the current versions'
client-element-metas parquets**, and noted drag-and-drop upload auto-unlinks elements not in
current versions — concluding the RCA is wrong. **His facts agree with our data** (we found
`inParquet: 418` on both models); he checked the **metadata** layer, we checked **geometry**.
The bug IS their disagreement. Two facts he hadn't seen:
- source file `bb85941b…` has **18,908 elements in loaded geometry but 0 of its 141 linked
  handles** — file present, elements gone → geometry-side removal, metadata retained;
- other activities in the **same models** select fine (Yash's repro) → viewer mapping works.
His auto-unlink point *supports* the RCA: that step reads the **element list**, which still
contains the 418 — exactly why auto-unlink missed them. **Deletion of the 418 is ON HOLD until
he's aligned** — his check deserved an answer, not an override.

### Refined root cause (plain wording that landed with the team)

Old ghost-element cases deleted whole **models** → linked elements survived partially in the
remaining models. Here nobody deleted a model: both models were **re-uploaded**, and the piece
of work these 418 represent (deep underground electrical — the activity is literally named
"(Retired)") was **removed/redrawn** in the new versions. Removal boundary = the activity's own
scope → all 418 vanish together → clean zero, in both models at once. The UI still says 418
because the current version's **element list still contains elements its geometry doesn't** —
that sync gap is the pipeline bug and the sharpest question for BE.

Status: root cause explained end-to-end; 418 list verified and exported; deletion pending peer
alignment; project-wide sweep pending harvest run or BE query; FE robustness fix still to be
scheduled.

## 2026-07-17 — refresh: no new Jira activity since 07-15; ticket idle on three human gates

Re-pulled all 11 comments. **The last comment is still Ilia's 2026-07-15 10:53 rebuttal to David
Webb** (comment 107412) — the one the 07-14/15 entry above already records — and the issue `updated`
timestamp equals that same moment. **Nothing has happened in the two days since.** Status unchanged:
**In Analysis**. No new evidence, no new theory, no reply, no approval.

What is waiting on a human, precisely (none of it in our own hands):

1. **Peer (BE) alignment — David Webb has not replied.** He challenged the RCA on 07-15 10:15
   (the sample element *is* in the current `client-element-metas`; drag-and-drop upload already
   auto-unlinks elements not in current versions ⇒ "not sure I agree"). Ilia answered 38 min later
   (metadata agrees on all 418, but the **geometry** side is empty; source file `bb85941b` has
   18,908 elements in geometry yet **0 of its 141 linked handles**; other activities in the same
   models select fine; auto-unlink reads the **element list**, which still carries the 418 — so it
   *supports* the RCA rather than refuting it). **David has posted nothing since.** Deletion of the
   418 remains ON HOLD pending his alignment.
2. **Product approval — Pietro & Mostafa have not replied.** Ilia asked both to approve deleting the
   418 dead links (07-14 17:49) and posted the list (17:53). Neither responded.
3. **BE pipeline "why" — unanswered.** David answered only the narrow question (object-id-map is
   generated for **Navis models only**, 07-14 17:12 — matches our `navisworks-model-mapper.ts:277`
   finding). The deeper root-cause question — *why does the current version's `client-element-metas`
   parquet still list 418 elements whose geometry the same version dropped, and is that artefact
   regenerated on re-version?* — has no answer.

Nobody else on the roster (Darminder, Sergey, Sachin, Ali Seyedof) has commented. **Assignee is now
Ilia Kuzmin** (self-assigned since he claimed the investigation on 07-13; the ticket was originally
assigned to Darminder).

Net: the *investigation* is finished and the RCA is confirmed (9/10, unchanged); the *ticket* is idle,
waiting on peer alignment + product approval + one BE pipeline answer. It needs a nudge and a clean
split, not more analysis. See `recommended-action.md` (2026-07-17 refresh).
